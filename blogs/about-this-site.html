                    <h3>In this blog, I'll explain how I went about making this site.</h1>
                        <pre>
Of course I won't be teaching you step by step on how to make your own site.
This blog is just to document some things that I found trouble on.

As you might've noticed. This site is very minimal and has little styling.
That's because of my love for minimalism and keeping things mostly in html.

So first things first! The project structure!

To give you a story. When I started working on this site. I did not have a-
project structure in mind nor naming rules and conventions. That made things-
a pain to work with after a while — as I did had to constantly keep track of-
messy things, names, and file contents. I recommend you take your time to make-
plans for these before you get started on your site.

It may not matter to the people looking at the site but it's essential to keep-
your project structure clean for maintainability.

This is what my project structure looks like, I tried my best to keep it clean.

main/
│
├── Main pages
│
├── items/
│   └── Button GIFs
├── media/
│   └── Image/Media
└── blogs/
    └── Blog pages

I've seperated them by their own directories. This will make things easier to read-
and find in the future.

Now, onto the most painful one I had to deal with. The buttons.
Though it was easy to make the buttons. I had trouble finding a website/tool that-
satisfied my needs. I've linked the site for your convenience at the bottom of the blog.

That's all I have for this blog.
